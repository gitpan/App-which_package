NAME
    which_package - Determine which package installed a file

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     % which_package /path/to/file [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    Print out package information for packages that own a given file.

    For each file on the command line this program will print out the
    package name and type of package. It uses Alien::Packages to do this
    portably, so it should work, with various limitations, portably on a
    wide variety of platforms (Debian, RedHat and Cygwin have been tested).

    If given a command, "which_package" will use File::Which to find the
    location of that command and use that to query the package manager for
    ownership.

OPTIONS
    none, as yet.
