=head1 NAME

which_package - Determine which package installed a file

=head1 VERSION

version 0.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % which_package /path/to/file [ ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Print out package information for packages that own a given file.

For each file on the command line this program will print out the
package name and type of package.  It uses L<Alien::Packages> to
do this portably, so it should work, with various limitations, 
portably on a wide variety of platforms (Debian, RedHat and Cygwin
have been tested).

If given a command, C<which_package> will use L<File::Which> to
find the location of that command and use that to query the package
manager for ownership.

=head1 OPTIONS

none, as yet.
